# Snake Game JS

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js installed to use `http-server`. You can download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installing

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Imperfectwow/snakeJS.git
cd snake_game_js

Then, install the dependencies (if any):

npm install

Running the Game Locally
To run the game locally, you'll need to install http-server, a simple zero-configuration command-line static content server.

Install http-server globally via npm:

npm install -g http-server


Once installed, run the following command in the root directory of your project:

http-server

By default, http-server will start a local web server on port 8080. You can access the game by navigating to http://localhost:8080 in your web browser.

Enjoy playing the Snake game!
